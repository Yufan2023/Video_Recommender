# Netflix Recommendation System

## Overview
This project demonstrates a content-based recommendation system for Netflix titles. It uses two approaches for predicting similar content:

Scikit-learn Implementation: A machine learning-based recommendation system using a Random Forest Classifier.
TensorFlow Implementation: A deep learning-based recommendation system using a Neural Network.
The system recommends similar Netflix titles based on their genres, descriptions, release year, duration, and country of origin.
